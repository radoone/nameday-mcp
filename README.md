# Nameday MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides nameday information for multiple countries including Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, and others. This server allows you to find when a specific name has its nameday or discover which names celebrate on a particular date.

## Quick Functionality Test

You can quickly verify that the server works in both online (SSE/HTTP) and offline (stdio) modes:

### Online Mode (SSE/HTTP)

1. **Start the server in online mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:sse
   # or for production:
   npm run start:sse
   ```
2. **Run the test script:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-online.js
   ```
   - Optionally, set the SERVER_URL environment variable if testing a remote server:
     ```bash
     SERVER_URL="http://localhost:3000" node scripts/test-online.js
     ```
3. **Expected result:**
   - All tests should pass (you will see âœ… in the console).

> **Note:** The test script works only for the online (HTTP API) mode.

### Offline Mode (STDIO, for Claude Desktop)

1. **Start the server in offline mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or for production:
   npm start
   ```
2. **Test via Claude Desktop:**
   - In Claude Desktop settings, add a new MCP server as described below (see "Claude Desktop Configuration").
   - Connect to the server and ask questions like:
     - "When is Peter's nameday?"
     - "Who has nameday on June 29th?"
     - "What Slovak names celebrate today?"
   - If you get a correct answer, the offline mode works.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the TypeScript code:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Usage

### Local Usage (stdio transport)

For local development and Claude Desktop integration:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or for production:

```bash
npm start
```

### Online Usage (SSE transport)

For web-based clients and online deployment:

```bash
npm run dev:sse
```

Or for production:

```bash
npm run start:sse
```

The server will be available at:
- Health check: `http://localhost:3000/health`
- SSE endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/sse`

## Deployment Options

### 1. Docker Deployment

Build and run using Docker:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t nameday-mcp-server .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e MCP_TRANSPORT=sse nameday-mcp-server
```

### 2. Docker Compose with Nginx

For production deployment with reverse proxy:

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### 3. Railway Deployment

Deploy to Railway.app:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
2. The `railway.toml` file will automatically configure the deployment
3. Your server will be available at `https://your-app.railway.app`

### 4. Cloudflare Workers

Deploy to Cloudflare's edge network:

1. Copy the code from `deploy/cloudflare-worker.js`
2. Go to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)
3. Create a new worker and paste the code
4. Deploy and access at `https://your-worker.your-account.workers.dev`

### 5. Other Cloud Platforms

The Docker container can be deployed to:
- **AWS ECS/Fargate**: Use the provided Dockerfile
- **Google Cloud Run**: Deploy directly from the container
- **Azure Container Instances**: Use the Docker image
- **Heroku**: Deploy using the Dockerfile
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Connect your repository

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `MCP_TRANSPORT`: Set to `"sse"` for online deployment, leave unset for local stdio
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000)
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to `"production"` for production deployments

### Claude Desktop Configuration

For local stdio usage:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nameday-mcp-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./dist/index.js"],
      "cwd": "./path/to/nameday-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

For online SSE usage with mcp-remote:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nameday-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://your-server.com/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Health Check
- **GET** `/health`
